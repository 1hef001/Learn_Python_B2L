In computer science, artificial inteligence (AI), sometimes called machine inteligence,
is inteligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural inteligence displayed 
by humans. Colloquially, the term "artificial inteligence" is often used to describe machines
(or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such
as "learning" and "problem solving". As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered 
to require "inteligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the 
AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For 
instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,
having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI 
include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic 
game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content 
delivery networks, and military simulations. Artificial inteligence can be classified into three
different types of systems: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial inteligence.
Analytical AI has only characteristics consistent with cognitive inteligence; generating a 
cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform 
future decisions. Human-inspired AI has elements from cognitive and emotnl inteligence; 
understanding human emotions, in addition to cognitive elements, and considering them in their
decision making. Humanized AI shows characteristics of all types of competencies (i.e., cognitive,
emotnl, and social inteligence), is able to be self-conscious and is self-aware in interactions.
